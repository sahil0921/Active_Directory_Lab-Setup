# Active_Directory_Lab-Setup

âœ…Active Directory Lab Setup

I've set up my own Active Directory lab to simulate and test various attack scenarios. I've intentionally added vulnerabilities to my lab to explore the following attacks:ðŸ”¥

- AS-REP Attack
- Kerberosting
- DC_sync
- DACL
- Trust Relationship Attack
- Constrained Delegation
- Unconstrained Delegation
- Credential Dumping
- Skeleton Key
- Pass the Hash
- Over the Pass
- Pass the Ticket
- Golden Ticket
- Silver Ticket
- ADCS - ESC1, ESC2, ESC3, ESC4
- Password Spraying
- Anonymous LDAP Query
- Shadow Copies
- Pass the Cache
- DCOM

Lab Requirements:

To set up this lab, you'll need:

- Minimum 32GB RAM (Including Attacking Machine)
- Minimum 6-core processor
- Minimum 150GB of free space

Lab Configuration:

My lab consists of two domains: one parent domain and one child domain. By setting up your own lab, you'll learn:

- How Active Directory works
- The main reasons behind these attacks
- How to execute these attacks (for testing and learning purposes)
- How to prevent these attacks

This lab setup allows me to explore and learn about various Active Directory attack scenarios, helping me improve my security knowledge and skills."

The setup is working fine without any errors. From tomorrow, I'll be practicing all these attacks to further enhance my skills. I've already tested some attacks and have samples to share.
